## Strategy Analysis

Strategy Analysis involves setting a clear direction for achieving an organization’s goals by aligning its resources and capabilities with defined objectives. It focuses on understanding where an organization currently stands, where it aims to be, and how it can bridge that gap efficiently. Strategies can be designed for different levels—whether it’s for an entire company, a specific department, or a single project. The objective of Strategy Analysis is to determine the best course of action for the enterprise to create or capture value by meeting a strategic need.

### Key Components of Strategy Analysis

1. **Analyze Current State**  
   This involves identifying the existing conditions of the organization, assessing current capabilities, and understanding the context within which the organization operates. By doing this, business analysts establish a baseline for what needs to change and can better define the issues or opportunities at hand.  
   *Example Application:* In a retail company looking to improve customer satisfaction, analysts might review current customer feedback, analyze existing customer service processes, and assess employee training programs to establish what’s working and what isn’t.

2. **Define Future State**  
   The future state is the vision of what the organization aims to achieve. It includes setting clear goals and objectives that will signal the success of meeting the business need. Defining this future state involves mapping out what will be different, including processes, systems, and organizational structure changes necessary to achieve the vision.  
   *Example Application:* A technology firm planning to enter a new market might set specific objectives like gaining 20% market share within two years. To achieve this, the firm could outline the skills, technologies, and distribution channels it needs to establish.

3. **Assess Risks**  
   Identifying potential risks is crucial to strategy analysis, as it ensures that uncertainties and challenges are anticipated and planned for. This step includes examining the likelihood of obstacles arising and their potential impact, as well as determining mitigation strategies.  
   *Example Application:* In a case where a company is planning a product launch in a highly regulated industry, analysts might assess risks related to compliance issues, potential customer backlash, or unforeseen operational costs, developing contingency plans to address these risks if they materialize.

4. **Define Change Strategy**  
   The change strategy provides a roadmap for moving from the current state to the future state. This step involves performing a gap analysis to identify what’s missing in the current state compared to the desired future state. Business analysts then recommend the best approach for making this transition, which may involve multiple stages or transition states.  
   *Example Application:* A healthcare provider seeking to integrate electronic health records (EHR) might recommend a phased rollout starting with one department before expanding organization-wide, minimizing disruptions while optimizing workflows.

### The Core Concept Model (BACCM™) in Strategy Analysis

This model connects six core concepts crucial to Strategy Analysis:

- **Change:** Business analysts define the future state and outline the changes necessary to achieve it.
- **Need:** Identifying and prioritizing needs help determine what the organization aims to address.
- **Solution:** The defined solution scope provides clarity on how the identified needs will be met.
- **Stakeholder:** Analysts collaborate with stakeholders to understand needs, set the direction, and ensure the strategy aligns with their expectations.
- **Value:** Determining the potential value of a solution justifies the change and its importance.
- **Context:** Considering internal and external factors allows the strategy to be adaptable and relevant to the enterprise's circumstances.

### Example of Strategy Analysis in Action: A Technology Start-up

Imagine a start-up developing an app that helps people with fitness routines. The team performs a strategy analysis to refine its business model and roadmap. Here’s how they apply each component:

1. **Analyze Current State:** The team evaluates its current product, reviews user feedback, and assesses the competition.
2. **Define Future State:** They set a goal to achieve a 40% user increase within a year and increase engagement through added features like virtual coaching.
3. **Assess Risks:** They identify risks, such as user drop-off rates due to feature complexity, and create strategies to mitigate this risk through usability testing.
4. **Define Change Strategy:** The team develops a phased approach to introduce new features, starting with a beta version and gathering feedback before a full release.

Through these steps, the start-up moves from concept to execution, with a focused and adaptable plan that supports its growth objectives.
