# Understanding the Purpose of Elicitation

Elicitation is a key process in business analysis that involves gathering important information that is relevant to a particular change in an organization. This change could be the introduction of a new system, an update to an existing process, or any other transformation. The information gathered is used to guide decisions, solve problems, and implement solutions.

## Why is Elicitation Important?

Before any major decision is made in an organization, it is important to understand all the relevant details. Elicitation helps to draw out the knowledge, experiences, and insights of different stakeholders to make sure that the right decision is made. The process involves not only asking questions but also analyzing documents, studying past data, and sometimes even conducting tests to uncover information that wasn’t previously known.

### Types of Elicitation:

There are three common types of elicitation that can be applied:

1. **Collaborative Elicitation:**
   - This involves direct interaction with stakeholders. Stakeholders are the people who are affected by the change or who have knowledge about it. This type of elicitation relies on their experiences, expertise, and judgment. For example, during the development of a new mobile app for a company, stakeholders (like managers and employees) may be asked for feedback on the features they believe the app should have.

2. **Research-Based Elicitation:**
   - Research involves looking for information that might not be directly known by the stakeholders. This could involve reviewing past data or looking into external sources like industry reports. For instance, when launching a new product, a company might research the market to identify trends, customer preferences, and what competitors are offering.

3. **Experiment-Based Elicitation:**
   - Sometimes, information can’t be gathered just by asking people or reading documents. It needs to be discovered through experiments or controlled tests. For example, when a company wants to determine how customers will respond to a new product feature, they might create a prototype and have customers try it out, gathering feedback on what works and what doesn’t.

### Elicitation in Action: A Case Study

Imagine a company that wants to implement a new software system to improve its customer service. The business analyst needs to gather all the relevant information to make sure the software meets the needs of the business and its customers.

1. **Collaborative Approach:** The business analyst conducts interviews with customer service representatives, managers, and customers to understand the current problems with the system and what improvements they want.
  
2. **Research Approach:** They also analyze past performance data of the customer service system and look at how similar companies have improved their services.

3. **Experiment Approach:** Before fully rolling out the new system, the company runs a pilot program in one department to see how the new software performs in real-world conditions. Feedback from this experiment helps fine-tune the system.

By using all three types of elicitation, the company gathers all the necessary information to make sure the new system will be effective.

# Recognizing Types of Elicitation

In business analysis, elicitation refers to the process of gathering essential information to understand a problem, define a solution, or make informed decisions about organizational changes. There are three main types of elicitation that are commonly used: **Collaborative**, **Research-based**, and **Experiment-based**. Understanding these types helps business analysts choose the right approach to uncover and collect the most useful information for a project.

### 1. **Collaborative Elicitation**

Collaborative elicitation involves directly interacting with stakeholders, which are people who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. These could be employees, customers, managers, or even suppliers. The goal is to gather knowledge, opinions, and expertise from these stakeholders to better understand the needs and challenges the organization is facing.

For example, if a company is developing a new customer service system, collaborative elicitation could involve interviewing customer service representatives and team leaders to understand the limitations of the current system and what they expect from a new one. Workshops or brainstorming sessions with these stakeholders could also be organized to generate ideas for new features or improvements.

#### Key Activities in Collaborative Elicitation:
- **Interviews:** One-on-one discussions with stakeholders to gather detailed insights.
- **Workshops:** Group sessions where stakeholders collaborate to solve problems or define requirements.
- **Focus Groups:** Collecting feedback from a diverse group of stakeholders to identify needs and preferences.

### 2. **Research-Based Elicitation**

Research-based elicitation involves systematically studying information from materials, documents, or external sources that may not be directly known by stakeholders. It could include analyzing historical data, reviewing market trends, or looking at competitors to discover insights that stakeholders might not be aware of. This approach helps the business analyst uncover facts that could influence the decision-making process.

For example, when launching a new product, research-based elicitation may involve studying market reports to identify emerging trends or understanding how competitors' products are performing. This data-driven approach is valuable in providing a broader perspective that goes beyond individual opinions.

#### Key Activities in Research-Based Elicitation:
- **Document Analysis:** Reviewing company policies, historical data, or industry standards to gather relevant information.
- **Benchmarking:** Comparing an organization's processes or performance against industry best practices.
- **Data Analysis:** Identifying patterns in historical data, such as customer feedback or sales trends.

### 3. **Experiment-Based Elicitation**

Experiment-based elicitation is used when information cannot be drawn from documents or stakeholders because it is unknown. Controlled tests or experiments are carried out to discover new information. This method is useful when a project requires testing ideas, solutions, or prototypes before making final decisions.

For example, if a company is considering launching a new website design, they might create a prototype and conduct usability tests to see how users interact with the site. This feedback helps the company refine the design before launching the final version.

#### Key Activities in Experiment-Based Elicitation:
- **Prototyping:** Creating a model or version of a product to gather feedback and test ideas.
- **Observational Studies:** Observing users as they interact with a system to understand their behavior and preferences.
- **Proof of Concept:** Testing whether an idea is feasible and could be implemented successfully.

### Case Study: Redesigning a Company’s Website

A retail company is planning to redesign its website to improve the user experience and increase online sales. Here’s how the three types of elicitation might be used in this project:

1. **Collaborative Elicitation:** The business analyst holds workshops with the marketing team and customers to understand the current challenges with the website. They discuss issues such as slow loading times, difficult navigation, and what new features customers would like to see.

2. **Research-Based Elicitation:** The analyst reviews website performance metrics from the past year, identifying patterns in user behavior, such as high bounce rates on certain pages. They also benchmark the website’s performance against competitors in the industry to determine what improvements need to be made.

3. **Experiment-Based Elicitation:** A prototype of the new website is created, and usability tests are conducted with a group of customers. Observing how customers navigate the site provides valuable feedback on what works well and what needs further adjustment.

By using all three elicitation types, the company gathers a comprehensive understanding of what improvements are needed and how to implement them effectively.

# Guide and Capture Elicitation Activities

Elicitation is not just about gathering information—it's about steering discussions in a way that uncovers valuable insights and capturing the details for future use. Effective guidance and documentation are critical to ensuring that the elicitation process yields useful and actionable data. This section focuses on how to guide elicitation sessions, ensure relevant discussions, and capture the outcomes effectively.

### 1. **Guiding Elicitation Sessions**

Guiding an elicitation session involves ensuring that discussions stay on track and the goals of the session are met. As a business consultant or analyst, it’s important to take an active role in facilitating conversations, ensuring participants focus on the topics at hand, and making sure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute.

To guide these sessions, you must start with clear objectives. Everyone involved should know the purpose of the session—whether it’s to identify project requirements, uncover stakeholder expectations, or brainstorm possible solutions. Setting a clear agenda helps keep the session focused and productive.

#### Techniques for Guiding Elicitation:
- **Set Clear Objectives:** Before the session begins, clarify what information or decisions are needed.
- **Create an Agenda:** Outline the topics of discussion and allocate time for each one.
- **Encourage Participation:** Ensure all relevant stakeholders contribute, especially those who may have valuable insights but are hesitant to speak.
- **Redirect Off-Topic Discussions:** Politely bring the conversation back to the agenda if it strays off course.

#### Example:
In a project where a company is developing a new internal communication platform, the business analyst guides a series of workshops. The agenda includes understanding current communication challenges, gathering feature requests, and prioritizing which features are most critical. By keeping the session focused on these objectives, the team avoids distractions and ensures the final outcomes are aligned with the company’s goals.

### 2. **Ensuring Relevant Discussions**

Ensuring that discussions are relevant to the project goals is critical. It is common for meetings to drift into unrelated areas, especially if multiple stakeholders are involved. As a leader in the session, it’s your job to gently steer conversations back on track. One effective way to do this is by continually linking the conversation to the project’s objectives or business outcomes.

You can use targeted questions to encourage discussions that align with the session’s goals. For instance, if the topic is about improving customer service, questions should be directed toward understanding what features, tools, or workflows can improve the customer experience.

#### Techniques to Ensure Relevance:
- **Ask Focused Questions:** Direct questions that guide stakeholders toward specific information.
- **Reiterate the Objectives:** When discussions veer off, remind participants of the session’s goals.
- **Summarize Key Points:** Regularly summarize what has been discussed to confirm that the group is aligned with the objectives.

#### Example:
In a case where a company is trying to reduce delays in its product delivery system, the business analyst may use specific questions like: “What steps in the current process lead to the most delays?” or “What tools could speed up product packaging and dispatch?” These questions ensure the conversation remains focused on addressing the delivery delays.

### 3. **Capturing Elicitation Outcomes**

Capturing the outcomes of elicitation sessions is crucial for future analysis and use. Accurate documentation of the discussions, ideas, and decisions made during these sessions ensures that nothing important is forgotten or misunderstood. The documentation also provides a reference for later phases of the project, helping to keep the team aligned and focused.

There are several ways to capture outcomes, depending on the format of the elicitation session. Notes, audio recordings, and visual aids like flowcharts or mind maps can all be effective. It’s important to summarize key points, actions, and decisions made, and to get validation from stakeholders afterward to ensure the accuracy of what was captured.

#### Techniques for Capturing Outcomes:
- **Take Detailed Notes:** Record important points discussed, decisions made, and action items.
- **Use Visual Tools:** Tools like mind maps or diagrams can help capture and represent complex ideas.
- **Validate with Stakeholders:** Share notes or summaries with stakeholders after the session to confirm accuracy.
- **Organize and Store Data:** Ensure all elicitation data is organized and accessible for future reference.

#### Example:
In the same project of developing a new internal communication platform, the business analyst captures outcomes by summarizing the key features requested by users, such as real-time messaging and task tracking. A flowchart is created to map out how these features would integrate with existing systems. The notes are validated by stakeholders to ensure all critical needs have been accurately recorded.

### Case Study: Improving a Retail Customer Feedback System

A retail company wants to improve its customer feedback system to better understand customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. The business analyst organizes several elicitation sessions to guide and capture stakeholder input.

1. **Guiding Elicitation:** During a workshop with store managers and customer service teams, the analyst sets clear objectives: to identify current gaps in feedback collection and brainstorm ways to improve the system. The session remains focused by keeping the discussion aligned with these goals and regularly summarizing key points.

2. **Ensuring Relevant Discussions:** To avoid unrelated discussions, the analyst asks focused questions like, “What is the most common complaint from customers?” and “How can we make the feedback process easier for both customers and staff?” These targeted questions ensure that the discussion stays on track.

3. **Capturing Outcomes:** At the end of the session, the analyst takes detailed notes of all ideas presented, including the need for a mobile-friendly feedback system and the suggestion to offer incentives for customers who leave feedback. A follow-up email is sent to validate the accuracy of the captured outcomes.

By effectively guiding the session, ensuring relevant discussions, and accurately capturing the outcomes, the retail company is able to gather actionable insights that lead to the successful improvement of its feedback system.

# Utilize Elicitation Techniques and Tools

Elicitation techniques are essential for gathering detailed information from stakeholders, team members, and other sources. These techniques help in extracting, analyzing, and interpreting the data necessary to make informed decisions for projects or organizational changes. Various methods can be employed based on the context, and knowing when and how to apply them is critical for effective business analysis.

### 1. **Brainstorming**

Brainstorming is a collaborative technique used to generate a wide range of ideas from participants. It’s commonly used at the beginning of projects when the goal is to gather as many ideas as possible. The process encourages open discussions without judgment, allowing creativity to flow freely. 

#### How It Works:
- A group of stakeholders is gathered in a session.
- The facilitator presents a problem or objective, and participants are encouraged to suggest ideas.
- No idea is dismissed during the session; all contributions are recorded.
- After the brainstorming session, ideas are reviewed, categorized, and prioritized.

#### Example:
In a case where a company wants to enhance customer engagement, a brainstorming session could generate ideas such as launching a loyalty program, improving the user interface of the company’s app, or offering more personalized services.

### 2. **Interviews**

Interviews involve one-on-one or small group conversations between the business analyst and stakeholders. They are particularly useful for gaining in-depth insights into specific issues or areas where detailed understanding is required. Interviews allow stakeholders to express their thoughts, concerns, and needs in a structured way.

#### How It Works:
- The business analyst prepares a set of questions related to the project or problem.
- During the interview, the analyst asks questions to the stakeholders, encouraging them to provide detailed responses.
- The information gathered is documented for later analysis.

#### Example:
For a project aimed at improving internal workflows, the analyst might interview department managers to understand specific bottlenecks or inefficiencies within their teams.

### 3. **Document Analysis**

Document analysis involves reviewing existing documentation, such as reports, process manuals, contracts, and project plans. It is an effective technique for gathering information without directly involving stakeholders and helps to understand the current state of processes or systems.

#### How It Works:
- The business analyst collects relevant documents and reviews them for information.
- Key insights are extracted, including current workflows, historical decisions, and existing requirements.
- The information gathered is synthesized and analyzed to support decision-making.

#### Example:
In a case where a company is planning to implement new software, document analysis of the existing system’s manual and reports can help the analyst understand the limitations and requirements for the new solution.

### 4. **Prototyping**

Prototyping involves creating a preliminary version of a system or product to gather feedback. Prototypes can be basic sketches, wireframes, or fully functioning models that allow stakeholders to visualize the final product. This technique is particularly useful in iterative development, where ongoing feedback and adjustments are required.

#### How It Works:
- The business analyst works with designers or developers to create a prototype based on initial requirements.
- The prototype is presented to stakeholders, who then provide feedback on its functionality, design, and usability.
- Based on the feedback, adjustments are made, and the prototype is refined.

#### Example:
In the development of a new mobile app, a prototype could be created to show how users would navigate through the app’s features. Stakeholders can provide feedback on the user interface, functionality, and other aspects before development begins.

### Case Study: Launching a New E-Commerce Platform

A retail company is planning to launch a new e-commerce platform to expand its market reach. The business analyst uses several elicitation techniques to gather information and ensure that the platform meets the company’s needs.

1. **Brainstorming:** A brainstorming session with marketing, sales, and customer service teams generates ideas such as offering discount codes, creating an online chat feature for customer support, and integrating social media for promotions.

2. **Interviews:** The analyst interviews the IT department to understand the technical challenges they may face in integrating the new platform with existing systems. These interviews provide insight into the infrastructure requirements.

3. **Document Analysis:** The business analyst reviews the company’s existing sales reports and customer feedback to understand common complaints about the current online shopping experience. This analysis highlights the need for better product search functionality.

4. **Prototyping:** A prototype of the platform is created, showing how users will browse products, add items to the cart, and check out. Stakeholders provide feedback, and several features are adjusted based on their input before the full platform is developed.

Through these techniques, the company successfully gathers the necessary information to develop a user-friendly e-commerce platform that meets both business and customer needs.

This approach is efficient for gathering general opinions, preferences, and satisfaction levels. It is particularly helpful when you need to collect data from many people in a short amount of time.

#### **4. Prototyping and Demos**
Prototypes and demos are excellent tools for engaging end users and technical teams. Stakeholders can interact with a prototype of the system or product and provide feedback on its functionality and usability. This hands-on approach makes it easier to visualize how the system will work, leading to more concrete and actionable feedback.

### 3. **Challenges in Stakeholder Engagement**

While engaging stakeholders is vital, there are potential challenges that can arise during the elicitation process. Addressing these challenges proactively ensures that the elicitation activities are successful.

- **Lack of Availability**: Some stakeholders, especially high-level managers or busy customers, may not always be available for meetings or feedback sessions. In these cases, it is important to plan ahead and find ways to engage them efficiently, such as scheduling shorter, more focused meetings or using digital tools like surveys.

- **Conflicting Priorities**: Different stakeholders may have conflicting views on what the project should achieve. For example, management might prioritize cost savings, while end users are more concerned with ease of use. It’s essential to balance these perspectives and find a compromise that satisfies all parties.

- **Communication Barriers**: Stakeholders may have different levels of technical understanding or familiarity with the project. Tailoring your communication style and ensuring that all stakeholders are on the same page is key to overcoming these barriers.

### Case Study: Implementing a New Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System

A company plans to implement a new CRM system to improve customer tracking and support. The business analyst must engage various stakeholders to gather the necessary information for the system's development.

1. **Customers**: The business analyst organizes a series of interviews with key customers to understand their expectations from a CRM system. Customers share that they want more personalized interactions with the company, which leads to the inclusion of features such as customer history tracking and personalized messaging.

2. **Domain Experts**: The analyst works closely with domain experts to ensure the new CRM system complies with industry regulations, such as data privacy laws. Their input ensures the system handles sensitive customer data securely.

3. **End Users**: Sales and support teams who will use the CRM system daily participate in a workshop where they provide insights into their current workflows. Based on their feedback, the system is designed to be user-friendly, with a focus on reducing time spent on administrative tasks.

4. **Management and Decision Makers**: The analyst conducts regular meetings with senior management to align the project with the company’s broader goals, such as increasing customer retention and reducing operational costs.

5. **Project Teams**: Developers and IT teams participate in prototyping sessions to assess the technical feasibility of the system. Their feedback helps to adjust the system’s design to ensure smooth integration with existing company systems.

By engaging all the relevant stakeholders, the company successfully implements a CRM system that meets customer expectations, complies with regulations, and improves efficiency for end users.
