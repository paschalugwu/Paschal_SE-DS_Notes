## **Tools for Defining Design Options**  

Selecting the right design option requires specific tools to evaluate feasibility, scope, and implementation strategies.  

### **1. Future State Descriptions**  
A future state description outlines what the business or system will look like after implementing the new design option. It helps stakeholders visualize the benefits and changes.  

**Example:** A bank planning to introduce AI-driven customer service creates a future state description that includes expected response times, customer satisfaction improvements, and cost savings.  

### **2. Solution Scope**  
Solution scope defines the boundaries of the proposed solution, including what is included and excluded from implementation. It prevents scope creep and ensures focused execution.  

**Example:** A manufacturing company designing a new inventory tracking system limits the solution scope to warehouse operations, excluding transportation logistics for now.  

### **3. Existing Solutions**  
Analyzing existing solutions helps determine if enhancements or modifications are needed instead of developing a new system from scratch.  

**Example:** A hospital looking to improve patient record management realizes that their existing system can be upgraded with cloud storage instead of purchasing a new one.
