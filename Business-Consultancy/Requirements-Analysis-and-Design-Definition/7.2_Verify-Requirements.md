# Quality Characteristics of Requirements and Designs

## Key Concepts

### What Are Quality Characteristics of Requirements and Designs?
Quality characteristics are essential attributes that ensure requirements and designs meet the needs of stakeholders and are suitable for implementation. These characteristics help avoid misunderstandings, reduce errors, and ensure the project’s success.

### **Key Quality Characteristics**  
1. **Atomic**:  
   - **Definition**: A requirement or design should represent a single need or idea without combining multiple concepts.  
   - **Importance**: Prevents confusion and ensures each requirement can be managed and tested independently.  
   - **Case Study Application**: In a mobile banking app, "Users can log in" is atomic, while "Users can log in and transfer money" is not.  

2. **Complete**:  
   - **Definition**: All necessary details are included, leaving no room for assumptions.  
   - **Importance**: Ensures stakeholders fully understand what is being implemented.  
   - **Case Study Application**: A complete design for a shopping cart includes item addition, removal, and checkout process.  

3. **Consistent**:  
   - **Definition**: Requirements and designs should not conflict with one another.  
   - **Importance**: Eliminates ambiguities and avoids implementation delays.  
   - **Case Study Application**: If one requirement states, "The system will support English only," another cannot state, "The system must support multiple languages."  

4. **Concise**:  
   - **Definition**: Clearly stated with no unnecessary words or repetition.  
   - **Importance**: Simplifies understanding and reduces misinterpretation.  
   - **Case Study Application**: Instead of "The user interface must be simple and easy to navigate," use "The interface must be user-friendly."  

5. **Feasible**:  
   - **Definition**: Technically, financially, and operationally possible to implement within constraints.  
   - **Importance**: Saves time and resources by focusing on what can be achieved.

6. **Unambiguous**:  
   - **Definition**: Clearly understood without multiple interpretations.  
   - **Importance**: Reduces errors during implementation.  
   - **Case Study Application**: Instead of "The system should be fast," specify "The system should process transactions in under 2 seconds."  

7. **Testable**:  
   - **Definition**: Can be validated through tests or measurable criteria.  
   - **Importance**: Ensures requirements can be verified post-implementation.  
   - **Case Study Application**: "The system must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users" is testable; "The system must handle many users" is not.  

8. **Prioritized**:  
   - **Definition**: Ranked in order of importance to stakeholders.  
   - **Importance**: Guides development efforts to deliver maximum value first.  
   - **Case Study Application**: A ride-sharing app might prioritize features like booking rides over adding gamification elements.  

9. **Understandable**:  
   - **Definition**: Easily comprehended by all stakeholders, regardless of technical expertise.  
   - **Importance**: Facilitates collaboration and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.  
   - **Case Study Application**: Use plain language for user stories, avoiding jargon like "asynchronous callbacks" when unnecessary.
